Solitare Prime is an exercise to teach how classes work in C++
Solitaire is a card game that is played by one person. Solitaire is also known by the name "Patience". It is estimated that there are more than 1700 different versions of Solitaire... make that 1701 because we are inventing a new Solitaire game today. Welcome to Solitaire Prime! This game uses one standard deck of cards. Here are the rules: 
1) Take the top card from the deck and place it face up on the table.
2) The Sum is now the value of that card (Ace = 1, 2 = 2, ... 10 = 10, Jack = 10, Queen = 10, King = 10) 
3) If the Sum is a prime number, discard that pile, and start over at instruction #1 
4) If the Sum is not prime, take the next card from the top of the deck and place it on top of the pile on the table.
5) The Sum is now the sum of all cards in the pile on the table. 
6) Go to instruction #3.
